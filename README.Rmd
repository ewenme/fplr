[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ewenme/fplR.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ewenme/fplR) 

An R package that provides a compendium of tools for working with [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com) (FPL) data in R. 

## Installation

Get the development version from GitHub. Because of the lack of dev support from FPL, I am unlikely to submit this to CRAN in the near future.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# If you haven't installed devtools yet, do so
install.packages("devtools")

# install package from github
devtools::install_github("ewenme/fplR")
```

## Usage

### Example analysis

[FPL Mythbusting with fplR](http://ewenme.rbind.io/blog/2017-06-25-fpl_mythbusting/)

### Player data examples

#### Get summary data on all players in the current FPL season

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(fplR)

# player data for current FPL season:
players()
?players

```

#### Get detailed data (gameweek-level) on a player in the current FPL season (season has to be underway)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(fplR)

# Gameweek-level data for a player in the current FPL season:
playerDetailed(player_id = 12)
?playerDetailed

```

### User data examples

#### Get data on a user's player picks for a gameweek in the current FPL season (season has to be underway)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(fplR)

# player data for current FPL season:
userPicks(user_id = 123, gameweek = 10)
?userPicks

```
